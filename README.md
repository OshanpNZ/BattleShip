# BattleShip
**Introduction**

This project is a text-based Battleship game created in C. The game involves initializing a map, placing ships, and allowing the player to fire shots to sink the ships.

**Description**

The Project.c file in the Battleship repository implements a text-based version of the classic game Battleship in C. The program initializes a game map, places ships randomly on the map, and allows a player to take shots at the map to try and sink the ships. It checks for hits, misses, and when all ships are sunk to declare the game over. The game includes functions for setting up the map, placing ships, handling player input for shots, and updating the game state based on the shots fired.
